\section{Distributed locking}

A distributed lock manager can be implemented in many different ways. One such
method is using a consensus algorithm.

\section{Ditributed consensus}

Write about consensus. - what is consensus.
Paxos is one such algorithm. Most other algorithms are variations of paxos.

\section{Fallacies of distributed computing}

As with any distributed system, this one is also suscuptable to possible common
failures of a ditributed system.

\section{CAP}

{define CAP.}

In this project, we focus mainly on consistency as a primary goal with 
availability as a secondary goal. (Partition tolerance is never really an
option).

\section{Challenges}

Overcoming the inherent problems in a distributed system provides its own set of
challenges.

\subsection{Scale}

{define scaling, its limitations from this project's perspective}

\subsection{Configuration}

\subsection{Deploy}

{describe release early, release often, need for hot fixes, uninteruppted
releases}

\subsection{Failure tolerance}

Machine failure common in commodity machines.

Google number of machine failures.

Need robust software to deal with faulty hardware.

Deals with only non-byzantine failures.

\subsection{Bug detection and fixing}

Inherent problem in detecting bugs in a distributed system.

Reproducing the bug.

\subsection{Testing}

Unit tests, system tests, integration tests

Testing single node vs testing cluster

System testing vs liveliness testing

\subsection{Performance}

Benchmarking and pushing code to be performance oriented.
