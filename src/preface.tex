\chapter{Preface}

The idea behind Warlock was born of a real project need at Wooga by Paolo Negri
and Knut Nesheim. Paolo, as the thesis supervisor, helped me out with the
project's conceptualization, feature set and figuring out some hard problems
during the course of the project. Knut was very patient and helpful in boucing
around ideas and trying to push Erlang to its limits. My deepest gratitude to 
them both.

Justin Pearson, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Information Technology,
Uppsala University gracefully accepted to be the thesis reviewer and provided
valuable input on the report. Olle Eriksson, Senior Lecturer at the Department
of Information Technology, Uppsala University was really helful as thesis
co-ordinator with his excellent organization.

I would like to thank Anders Berglund, Ivan Christoff and staff of Department
of Information Technology for taking care of all the required formalities.

Wooga GmbH, Berlin hosted me for five months and provided me with all the 
resources necessary to complete my thesis. This project would not have 
been possible without the enthusiatic support from the people 
at Wooga. Thanks to Marc Hämmerle for the lively project discussions and 
the Wooga backend team for the positive support.

I would also like to thank Olle Gällmo from Uppsala University for the
Project CS course. It allowed us to work on a large Erlang project,
a visit to the Erlang User Conference 2011, Stockholm, where I was
introduced to Wooga.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank the scientific and open
source community for all their contributions to further the progress in the
field of computing.\\
