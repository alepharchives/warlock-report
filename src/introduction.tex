Distributed software systems sometimes use services that allow them to 
synchronize their activities or in order to access a shared resource. Such a
service could itself act as a single point of failure depending on the
application architecture.

\section{Problem}

Online social game Magic Land uses a stateful application server architecture to
handle millions of users. This architecture uses Redis as a global registry to
keep track of user sessions. Failure of the software Redis, or the machine it
runs on can lead to application downtime.

\section{Objective}

This thesis deals with the design and implementation of a locking service that
provides strong consistency, high-availability and performance.

\section{Outline}
The thesis is divided into three main sections.

The first section provides the context and background information related to the
project. It details the problem backgound, related projects, the research
area and the set of requirements the project is based on.

The second section describes the analysis, design, implementation of the project
and the experiments performed on it.

The final section discusses the project results and provides an outline for
the future work.
