\chapter{Abstract}

Locking primitives are one of the mechanisms used by distributed systems
to synchronize access to shared data or to serialize its actions. Depending
on the design, the manager providing this locking service may constitute
a single point of failure. This requires the manager itself to be
distributed. Distributed solutions that address this using weak consistency 
models might lead to diverging states which in some cases are not possible to
merge without acceptable effort. The solutions that are based on strong
consistency models dictate the requirement of a static cluster.

We propose a design that combines Multi-Paxos algorithm with the idea of
reconfigurable state machine for a locking service. The primary goal of
the service is strong consistency with availability and performance as
secondary requirements.

We demonstrate the feasibility of such a design by creating an implementation
in Erlang and testing it to check if it conforms to specified requirements.
We demonstrate that it can provide the throughput required for a large
web application while guaranteeing strong consistency.
