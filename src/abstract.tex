\chapter{Abstract}

Locking primitives are one of the mechanisms used by distributed systems
to synchronize access to shared data or to serialize its actions. Depending
on the design, the manager providing this locking service may constitute
a single point of failure. This requires the manager itself to be
distributed. Distributed solutions that address this using weak consistency 
models might lead to diverging states which in some cases are not possible to
merge without acceptable effort. The solutions that are based on strong
consistency models dictate the requirement of a static cluster.

This thesis deals with creation of Warlock, a distributed
consensus service based on Paxos, that can be used as a distributed lock 
manager. The primary goal of Warlock is to provide strong consistency in a
dynamic cluster with availability and performance as secondary targets.

In this document we discuss relevant algorithms and projects on distributed 
computing and design the consensus service based on them. We also implement 
this design and evaluate its reliability, availability and performance aspects.
