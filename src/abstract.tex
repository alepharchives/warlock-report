\chapter{Abstract}

Certain distributed applications require that its users strictly have one
session across the distributed system at any given point of time. Systems
based on weak consistency models might lead to diverging user states which
in some cases are not possible to merge without acceptable effort.

Wooga, a social games company encouters this scenario for many of its
games, constituting a single point point of failure.

Warlock is an effort to create a distributed consensus service that can
be used as a distributed lock manager, tailor made for ditributed web
applications at Wooga. This document describes the analysis and design of
Warlock and details its Erlang based implementation and results. 
This paper also compares Warlock with many similar applications and points
out the use case differences between them.
